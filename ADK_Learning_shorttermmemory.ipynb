Visit the **Lisbon Cathedral (Sé de Lisboa)**, a striking example of Romanesque architecture, and then head up to **São Jorge Castle (Castelo de São Jorge)** for panoramic views of the city and the Tagus River.\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM): Traditional Portuguese Cuisine in Alfama.** Enjoy a traditional Portuguese lunch at a local tasca in Alfama. Look for dishes like *Bacalhau à Brás* (codfish with scrambled eggs and potatoes) or *Sardinhas Assadas* (grilled sardines, especially if you're there in summer).\n*   **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 6:00 PM): Baixa and Rossio Square.** Descend from Alfama into the elegant, grid-patterned streets of the **Baixa district**, rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake. Stroll through **Praça do Comércio**, one of Europe's largest squares, and then make your way to **Rossio Square (Praça do Rossio)**, a lively central hub with beautiful fountains and historic buildings.\n*   **Evening (7:00 PM onwards): Dinner and Fado in Chiado.** Head to the sophisticated **Chiado district** for dinner. Afterwards, experience an authentic **Fado show**, Portugal's soulful music, often found in intimate settings in Alfama or Chiado.\n\nHow does this sound for your first day in Lisbon?"

This historic district is characterized by its labyrinthine alleys, hidden squares, and traditional Fado houses, reflecting a pre-earthquake past. Take your time wandering through the narrow, cobbled streets. Within Alfama, you'll find the **Lisbon Cathedral (Sé de Lisboa)**, the oldest and most important church in the city, with a history dating back to 1147.

This former Moorish fortification, later a royal palace, stands as a testament to centuries of conquests and cultural shifts. You can explore its battlements, towers, and archaeological site, and enjoy the impressive panorama of Lisbon. A typical visit lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours. The castle is a significant landmark, having been occupied successively by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, and Moors before its capture by the Portuguese in 1147.\n",

I'll break it down day by day.\n\nHere's a proposed itinerary for your first day in Lisbon:\n\n**Day 1: Alfama's Charms and Castle Views**\n\n*   **Morning (9:00 AM - 1:00 PM): Explore the Alfama District & Lisbon Cathedral.**\n    Start your day by immersing yourself in Alfama, Lisbon's oldest neighborhood. This historic district is characterized by its labyrinthine alleys, hidden squares, and traditional Fado houses, reflecting a pre-earthquake past. Take your time wandering through the narrow, cobbled streets. Within Alfama, you'll find the **Lisbon Cathedral (Sé de Lisboa)**, the oldest and most important church in the city, with a history dating back to 1147. Its Romanesque style and fortress-like appearance make it a notable historic site. You can also visit its Gothic cloisters and treasury.\n\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM): Traditional Portuguese Lunch in Alfama.**\n    Enjoy a local meal in one of Alfama's charming restaurants. The area offers traditional Portuguese food options. You might even find some places with outdoor seating areas.\n\n*   **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 5:30 PM): Discover St. George's Castle (Castelo de São Jorge).**\n    Perched atop Lisbon's highest hill, St. George's Castle offers panoramic views and a deep dive into the city's ancient roots. This former Moorish fortification, later a royal palace, stands as a testament to centuries of conquests and cultural shifts. You can explore its battlements, towers, and archaeological site, and enjoy the impressive panorama of Lisbon. A typical visit lasts about 1 to 1.5 hours. The castle is a significant landmark, having been occupied successively by Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, and Moors before its capture by the Portuguese in 1147.\n\n*   **Evening (7:00 PM onwards): Dinner with Fado Music.**\n    For dinner, consider heading back to Alfama, or the Bairro Alto neighborhood, both known for traditional Fado music performances. Fado, a soulful music tradition, is said to have been born in Alfama.\n\nHow does this sound for your first day? We can adjust anything you like!"

This sprawling area is a showcase of various architectural styles and rich history. Allocate ample time to visit its key attractions:\n*   **St. Vitus Cathedral:** Marvel at this Gothic masterpiece, known for its intricate stained-glass windows, and the tombs of Czech kings and queens.\n*   **Old Royal Palace:** Step into the historic Vladislav Hall, famous for its impressive ribbed vaulting.\n*   **St. George's Basilica:** Explore this Romanesque basilica, one of the oldest churches within the castle complex.\n*   **Golden Lane:** Wander through this charming, narrow street lined with colorful 16th-century houses, once home to castle guards and goldsmiths, now housing small shops and historical exhibits.\n\n**Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:00 PM): Traditional Czech Lunch near Prague Castle**\nAfter exploring the castle, descend into the Lesser Town (Malá Strana) for a traditional Czech lunch. Consider **Kuchyň** for authentic Czech dishes with views near the castle gates, or **Malostranská Beseda** for a local experience in a beautifully restored Renaissance building.\n\n**Afternoon (2:00 PM - 5:30 PM): Ascend Petřín Hill for Panoramic Views and Greenery**\nHead to **Petřín Hill**, offering a refreshing change of scenery and breathtaking panoramic views of Prague.\n*   **Funicular Ride:** Take the scenic funicular railway up the hill from the Újezd tram stop (note: the funicular is closed for renovation until summer 2026, so consider walking or an alternative public transport route to reach the top).\n*   **Petřín Lookout Tower:** Climb this mini Eiffel Tower for unparalleled 360-degree views across the entire city, including Prague Castle and the Vltava River. An elevator is available for those who prefer not to climb the 299 steps.\n*   **Mirror Maze:** Enjoy a fun and whimsical experience in the Mirror Maze, which features both a labyrinth of mirrors and a \"hall of laughter\" with distorted reflections.\n\n**Late Afternoon/Early Evening (5:30 PM - 7:00 PM): Relax and Stroll**\nDescend Petřín Hill, perhaps taking a leisurely walk through the park's rose gardens or towards Kampa Island, allowing for some relaxation before dinner.\n\n**Dinner (7:00 PM onwards): Authentic Czech Dinner**\nFor dinner, continue your exploration of local cuisine. **U Malého Glena** in Lesser Town is a popular spot that combines a bar with good food and a jazz club downstairs.\n\n**Evening: Jazz Club Experience**\nImmerse yourself in Prague's vibrant jazz scene. Prague has a strong jazz tradition and several excellent clubs. Options like **Reduta Jazz Club** or **AghaRTA Jazz Club** are well-known for their live performances and intimate atmosphere. Enjoy the music and a drink, soaking in the city's unique nightlife.\n\n---\n\nHow does this plan for Day 2 sound? Would you like any adjustments, or are you ready to plan Day 3?"
